    "abstract": "Modeling a city poses a number of problems to computer graphics. Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urban spaces consist of a complex collection of buildings, parcels, blocks and neighbourhoods interconnected by streets. Accurately modelling both the appearance and the behaviour of dense urban spaces is a significant challenge. The recent surge in urban data and its availability via the Internet has fomented a significant amount of research in computer graphics and in a number of applications in urban planning, emergency management and visualization. In this paper, we seek to provide an overview of methods spanning computer graphics and related fields involved in this goal. Our paper reports the most prominent methods in urban modelling and rendering, urban visualization and urban simulation models. A reader will be well versed in the key problems and current solution methods.",
